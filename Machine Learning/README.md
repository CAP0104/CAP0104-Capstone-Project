# Fare Amount of Transportation Prediction

The purpose of this project is to predict the fare amount of transportation. For that, a machine learning model is builded for predicting the fare amount based on some parameters such as: pickup date and time, pickup longitude and latitude, dropoff longitude and latitude, etc. We are using Keras and Tensorflow Estimator in order to make the model.
